Recursion and Backtracking

This repository contains explanations and examples of recursion and backtracking techniques in computer science. Both recursion and backtracking are powerful problem-solving approaches that are commonly used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

Introduction to Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler instances of the same problem. Each recursive call operates on a smaller input, and the base case defines when the recursion should stop.

Basic Examples
Factorial Calculation: Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer.
Fibonacci Sequence: Generate the nth Fibonacci number using recursion.
Countdown: Print numbers from N to 1 using recursion.
Recursive vs. Iterative
Compare recursive and iterative approaches to problem-solving. Understand the advantages and limitations of recursion, and learn when to choose one over the other.

Introduction to Backtracking
Backtracking is an algorithmic approach to solving problems by trying out different possible solutions and undoing them if they fail to meet the problem's criteria. It's particularly useful for solving problems with multiple decision points or constraints.

Backtracking Examples
N-Queens Problem: Place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
Sudoku Solver: Solve a Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking approach.
Combinatorial Sum: Find all possible combinations of numbers that add up to a given sum.
Combining Recursion and Backtracking
Some problems require both recursion and backtracking for an efficient solution. Explore examples where these two techniques complement each other.

Tips and Best Practices
Understand the problem thoroughly before attempting to use recursion or backtracking.
Identify base cases and recursive cases clearly.
Ensure that your recursive functions converge towards the base case.
For backtracking, maintain a clear record of the choices made and undo them when needed.
Optimize by pruning branches of the search space that are not feasible.
